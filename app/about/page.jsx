          Hi, I&apos;m Cecilia, and I&apos;m a Software Engineer on a mission.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm tracking-tight text-captions sm:text-base text-left mt-3">
          For the past five years, I&apos;ve been a Registered Nurse in adult
          and neonatal intensive care units, where collaboration and
          problem-solving were daily essentials. During this time, I also
          worked as a COVID-19 crisis response nurse, which reinforced my skills
          for working in fast-paced, high-intensity environments.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm tracking-tight text-captions sm:text-base text-left mt-3">
          Witnessing firsthand the potential for technology and innovation to
          revolutionize healthcare, I embarked on a journey to marry my medical
          expertise with cutting-edge software development skills. With the
          arsenal gained from the Flatiron School Full Stack Software
          Engineering program and my rich medical background, I&apos;m poised to
          be a driving force in reshaping how technology enhances our healthcare
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm tracking-tight text-captions sm:text-base text-left mt-3">
          From completing an accelerated Bachelor of Science degree Summa Cum Laude
          to caring for our country&apos;s sickest patients, I have never
          met a challenge that I haven&apos;t fully embraced and overcome, and
          embarking on this new mission is no different.
