            Hi, I&apos;m Cecilia, and I&apos;m a Software Engineer on a mission.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm tracking-tight text-captions sm:text-base text-left mt-3">
            For the past five years, I&apos;ve been a Registered Nurse in adult
            and neonatal intensive care units, where collaboration and
            problem-solving were daily essentials. During this time, I also
            worked as a COVID-19 crisis response nurse, which reinforced my
            skills for working in fast-paced, high-intensity environments.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm tracking-tight text-captions sm:text-base text-left mt-3">
            Witnessing firsthand the potential for technology and innovation to
            revolutionize healthcare, I embarked on a journey to marry my
            medical expertise with cutting-edge software development skills.
            With the arsenal gained from the Flatiron School Full Stack Software
            Engineering program and my rich medical background, I&apos;m poised
            to be a driving force in reshaping how technology enhances our
            healthcare experiences.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm tracking-tight text-captions sm:text-base text-left mt-3">
            From completing an accelerated Bachelor of Science degree Summa Cum
            Laude to caring for our country&apos;s most critical patients, I
            have never met a challenge that I haven&apos;t fully embraced and
            overcome, and embarking on this new mission is no different.
